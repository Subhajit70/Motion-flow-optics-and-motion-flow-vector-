This dramatically reduces the amount of data needed.\\n\\nEfficient Data Representation:\\n\\nMotion vectors allow for the efficient representation of video data by focusing on changes rather than storing every pixel for each frame. This leads to significant compression without compromising visual quality.\\n\\nPrediction Mechanism:\\n\\nInter-frame Prediction: Uses motion vectors to predict the content of a frame based on one or more reference frames. Only the motion vectors and the residual error (difference between predicted and actual frame) are encoded.\\n\\nIntra-frame Prediction: Although typically less efficient, this method predicts pixel values within the same frame and is used for keyframes.\\n\\nApplications:\\nVideo Streaming: Reduces bandwidth requirements, enabling smoother playback over the internet.\\n\\nVideo Storage: Minimizes storage space needed for video files.\\n\\nReal-time Video Communication: Enhances the efficiency of video transmission in applications like video calls and conferencing.'"
